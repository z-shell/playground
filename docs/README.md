<h2>Pull-requests welcomed!</h2>

Feel free to submit your zshrc if it contains `zi` commands.

# Submitting zshrc

You can either:

- open a PR – fastest method
- submit an issue with URL to the zshrc (or with the zshrc pasted) – [a quick link](https://github.com/z-shell/playground/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=request-to-add-zshrc.md)

# The repository structure

The structure of the repository is very simple: in its main directory there are
directories located, named after the user-names of the submitting users. In
those directories there are the zshrc files that the user decided to share.

# Try configurations with docker

## Requirements

You should have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and `zsh` installed
to use this functionality. Check you have them present on your system:

```sh
docker version
zsh --version
```

The other dependency is interactive filter. You should have either
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) or
[fzy](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) in your `$PATH`. You might choose to install any of them via zi:

```sh
# Install fzf
zi ice from"gh-r" as"command"
zi load junegunn/fzf-bin
# or fzy
zi ice as"command" make"\!PREFIX=$ZPFX install" \
    atclone"cp contrib/fzy-* $ZPFX/bin/" \
    pick"$ZPFX/bin/fzy*"
zi load jhawthorn/fzy
```

Keep in mind you will need a few Gb of free space to store docker images.

## Running a configuration

To try a configuration, you have to clone this repository and execute a `run.sh` script:

```sh
# Clone repository with configurations
git clone 'https://github.com/z-shell/playground'
# Run the configuration picker
./playground/run.sh
```

… or you can install this repository as a `zsh` plugin!

```sh
# Then, install this repo
zi load z-shell/playground
# Run the command
playground
```

Now you will have to wait for a few minutes, while the required environment is
being installed into the docker image. The next time you will want to try
a configuration, loading it will take less time.
